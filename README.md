# Jupyter

Hei these are a bunch of Jupyter Notebooks that I have been workin on. 

Most of them are written in Pyhton but some also in SQL. All of them were projects either from school or from online courses with different backgrounds and ideas behind them.

The main ideas behind all projects were to understand data analysis tools such as data cleaning, data visualization and some applications of supervised machine learnig algorithm to work and analyze these datasets.
